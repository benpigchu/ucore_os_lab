# Environment Setup

Benpigchu works under the WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) on a Windows 10 Pro Insider machine.

On WSL we can manually install build utils and qemu on Ubuntu.

Notice that Windows use CRLF as line terminator instead of LF,
it should be converted before bash script executed.

If any other problem relative to the environment happens, it will be listed here.
